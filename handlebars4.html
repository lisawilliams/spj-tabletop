  <!-- 
  So this example works in the sense that it does put data from the spreadsheet
    into individual cells in an HTML table.  But for reasons I don't understand, 
    the code below takes the HTML table header rows and puts them UNDERNEATH
    the cells with the data in it ~~ so the table header rows "City" and Temperature"
    appear at the BOTTOM of the table, instead of at the top, where they are intended
    to go.  Why?  LW
    
    Update: it was putting it on the bottom because <table border> and the header
    row were above <div id =content>, which the script is pulling from.  Once inside,
    header rows are now at the top.  However, cells below the header row have no border.
 -->
 
 <!-- This is the #content div that the script at the bottom is looking for
 -->
      <div id="content">
      
    
      <!-- Here's some CSS I copied.  It does a nice job of styling the header row, but 
      doesn't do anything to the rows below the header row. 
      -->
      

	<table class="myTable">


<!-- Header row for the table.  It must be outside the <script> tag or it will repeat 
for each line, making each city its own separate table with one header row and one 
row of data below. -->

<!-- It turns out the 'width' property can be applied to both <th> and <tr> tags, which 
solves my spacing problem, although I still can't figure out how to get a border
on the table cells that are below the <script id=> line.  -->

<th width = 220px>City</th><th width = 220px>Temperature</th></tr>
  
<!-- Here's the script using handlebars.js.  This calls the data and populates
the cells.  -->
   
    <script id="weather-template" type="text/x-handlebars-template"/>


<tr>
        <td width = 220px>{{city}}</td>
		<td width = 220 px: align = "center" border ="1" >{{temperature}}</td>
</tr>

<!-- Here's stuff from the original example by Andy Boyle that I commented out to play around with 
putting the data in tables.

        <h2>{{city}}</h2>
